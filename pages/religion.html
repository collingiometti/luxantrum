            <p>The new value of life presented by spiritium created the foundation for an emerging religion based around life and balance, a direct contradiction to Aztec values. A god formed and became known as <span style="font-family: goudyItalic;">terra</span> (earth in latin), and it symbolized the preservation of life. It was believed that it was responsible for spiritium and the power it contains. A couple of factors leading to the birth of this religion were the opposition and fear of the sun gods and outside world, the tale of a new life given to the founders by the earth and healing powers in spiritium, and many others. </p>
            <p>The rise of these new ideals had many longlasting effects on the empire. A newfound desire to be almost one with the earth and increasing zen qualities contributed to the balance and harmony in not only society but also the structure and rule of the empire. These common beliefs also brought people together. Religious figures were praised and their ideas held power among the people. </p>
            <p>Religion was crucial to the development of the empire after the <span style="font-family: goudyItalic;">revelare</span>. When the world heard of the empire in the ground that harnessed the power of the earth, they began to submit. A cultish following emerged and the religion of Luxantrum quite literally held godlike power, supporting the expansion of the empire. A significant example of this was their influence on indegenous peoples in the americas. Word of the empire's Spanish defeat and divine powers led to groups of followers. These groups began to revolt against colonizers believing they had the power of <span style="font-family: goudyItalic;">terra</span> supporting them. The revolts were actually fairly successful, and the decline of European coloniesâ€™ power laid the groundwork for the expansion of Luxantrum.</p>
