            <p>Story of a group of nomads who left the Aztec Empire in a journey to escape the grasp of the sun gods. One night during their journey, they decided to take shelter in a cave, and while searching for an area to sleep, one member was convinced he felt an aura being emitted from inside the wall, his curiosity separating him from the group. He noticed a faint glow radiating from the wall, and started kicking and hitting it, to no avail. Suddenly, the wall started to collapse and before he knew it, he was running for his life with the caverns caving in behind him. He somehow found his way back to the group, but at that same moment, the floor began falling in, sending everyone plummeting down into the abyss, never to be seen again.</p>
            <p>The story of Luxantrum begins with the “founders”. It is said they woke up to a sea of stars*, in awe of the infinite vastness of the underground. This marked the dawn of the underground empire. <span style="font-family: goudyItalic;">(Historian Note, *these “stars” were spiritium embedded in the earth, their healing capabilities saved them from the incident described in the first paragraph)</span></p>

            <p>Around 1750, a few Spaniards were sent to explore a cave near their colony in the Mexican region. After traversing for a bit, they came across a tunnel cutting through the caverns that was distinctively different than before. Entering it, they were immediately given the strange feeling that other people have travelled through it before, and it wouldn’t go away. Their suspicions were cemented when they saw a light coming towards them, with the outline of people behind it. Out of fear, they bolted in the direction they came from in hopes to escape, and they continued to run unaware of the fact that the mysterious people also ran the opposite direction in fear. Both groups then went to inform their people of their sightings. The Spanish were able to do this rather quickly, but the people of luxantrum struggled to be heard as they were ants in such a vast ocean of people. Consequently, the city was caught rather unprepared when a large group of Spanish soldiers showed up a few days later. The violence that followed was new to the caverns, and it was apparent in their lack of fighting knowledge and even weaponry, leading to quite a bit of panic. However, after regaining their composure, they realized they did have an advantage. The power they possessed completely shadowed the Spanish. With the help of spiritium and advanced drilling technology (described later) used as weapons, they wiped out every threat. Closing themselves back off from the world, they began to recover though all mining and expansion was halted. This led to a few problems however. The constant expansion made up for the rapidly increasing population (described later), and without it, the empire quickly overpopulated. With this and the contact with the outside world, people began to question the ideas that had lasted for hundreds of years, and the idea of venturing out began to float in the air. Eventually, this idea reached the attention of the council, bringing a vote that would decide the fate of the empire forever. It was close, but in the end they made the decision to reopen the gates to the outside world.</p>
            <p>Knowledge of this fantastical empire spread quickly throughout the globe, and the empire went through considerable changes to adapt. This event became known as the <span style="font-family: goudyItalic;">revelare</span>, and marked the biggest event in history. Through religion, economy, technology, and many other things that will be described later, they grew to become a colossal world power at the center of the world.</p>
