        <tr><td><p>At the empire’s beginnings, there was a lack of any solid economy, really because they didn’t need one. Luxantrum was fueled by labor, and people’s lives revolved around their work. There was no purchasing anything, even food, as people were paid in housing and nourishment. However, the <span style="font-family: goudyItalic;">revelare</span> flipped this upside down. As the empire became connected to global trade, the introduction of new resources and ideas made it a necessity to establish an economic system. The absence of a currency was resolved through the creation of coins from the empire's abundance in various metals. The task of payment was put in the hands of the individual districts, who would divide the money between all of the workers. Markets also began to pop up and society started to change as people gained new freedoms. The introduction of new groups of people led to a system of taxation, further increasing the government’s wealth. Aware of the unimaginable riches that would come as a result of trading spiritium, the empire decided against it, believing they should protect it. Despite this, they still had an enormous amount of diverse metals that led to them becoming a major world economical power.</p></td></tr>
