        <tr><td><p>Before the <span style="font-family: goudyItalic;">revelare</span>, the absence of ethnic and religous diversity within the empire left space for the separation of districts to form social classes. At the very top was the famed council, followed by officials, with religious figures and scholars also regarded quite highly. At the bottom were the laborers such as farmers and miners. These classes were not so rigid, however, as children born into their districts had the opportunity to switch, and even advance into positions of power. </p></td></tr>

            <p>The <span style="font-family: goudyItalic;">revelare</span> introduced the empire to diversity, significantly shifting social structures. At first, the original luxantrians had more opportunities and power, though this gradually died as diversity normalized. However, the minor separations between districts remained continuous.</p>
            <p>There were no shortage of people in the empire, which was another effect of spiritium. Its presence allowed agriculture underground, and made itâ€™s production sky-high, leading to massive amounts of food, which led to huge population increases. Apart from this, people also lived longer lives. </p>
