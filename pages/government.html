        <tr><td><p>The division of labor dating back to the founders evolved to split the empire into several districts revolving around the work they do (Ex. farmers, miners, builders, scholars, etc.). Ruling the empire was a council comprised of individuals from each district. This council was responsible for maintaining balance, as it represented all the voices within the empire. One district, the officials, oversaw the interior working of the empire. This structure of rule was quite successful, and played a key role in the long lasting balance within the empire.</p></td></tr>
